# QA-AutoChallenge

## About me

  My name is Andrii. I am realy like to challenge myself with variety of tasks and new expirience. Sometimes I could be lazy and choose very simple tasks
with which I become bored quite fast. Thank you for this Challenge that it gave me some tension with deadlines, because of them I kept intrested the whole proccess.
I would like to come through the challenge again and master all my new skills.
  Also because of the information what I get here I found out that QA can be fun, thanks to mentors' support :)


**My experience**

  I have 7 years of expirience in marine engineering field. Currenly I found myself as Data Analyst in finance. Hope to move forward to Analytics in IT. I find this challenge usefull enough for this purposes. Thanks to tools which are used here in  daily basis.
